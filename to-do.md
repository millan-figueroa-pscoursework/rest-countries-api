- Interacting with static vs rendered elements
- Event delegation to be able to show country details view
- Installing the latest version of Tailwind, setting up global variables
- Separation of concerns (models, utilities, api)
- Using ts annotation for querySelector like <HTMLDivElement>. Its a generic which tells TypeScript that you're expecting the selected element to be an HTMLDivElement
