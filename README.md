# Extraction Atlas

Turning neutral country data into an impact-focused lens on global extraction and inequality.

Extraction Atlas maps the hidden environmental and social costs of digital infrastructure.

This project repurposes public country data to highlight how AI data centers, water insecurity, climate risk, weak regulation, and poverty intersect across regions.

Built as a portfolio project exploring ethical data modeling, advocacy-oriented dashboards, and nonprofit-facing tools.

# Core functionality

## 1️⃣ Start with neutral facts

Ingest standard country data (population, region, borders, flags).

## 2️⃣ Layer on impact signals

Adds a second, opinionated layer:

- AI data center presence

- Water insecurity

- Climate risk

- National debt pressure

- Poverty rate

- Tech regulation strength

- This is where the app becomes political/activist — by design.

## 3️⃣ Make the impact visible at a glance

That’s why the table-first view matters:

- Compare countries side by side

Patterns emerge immediately:

- high extraction + weak regulation

- high climate risk + high poverty

No reading reports, no charts required

## 4️⃣ Allow exploration without losing context

- Click a country → detail view

- See borders → understand regional spillover

- Go back → impact table is still there

- The user never “loses the map”.
